Understanding the Stream Hierarchy:

The code demonstrates the use of FileReader and BufferedReader for reading text files, which are part of the java.io package. This helps in understanding how low-level streams (like FileReader) can be wrapped by high-level streams (like BufferedReader) for efficiency.
Exception Handling:

You learn the importance of handling exceptions (IOException) that can occur during file operations.
Resource Management:

Using the try-with-resources statement ensures that streams are closed automatically, teaching good practices for resource management.
Efficiency:

The use of buffered streams (BufferedReader and BufferedWriter) highlights how buffering can optimize performance compared to directly reading or writing using unbuffered streams.
Practical Implementation:

By working on a real-world utility, you gain hands-on experience, making it easier to understand abstract concepts.
